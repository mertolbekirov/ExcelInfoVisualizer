# ExcelInfoVisualizer
WPF application which displays a DataGrid with info from an Excel file.

You can find the excel file used for this in the ExcelInfoVisualizer folder.

### NOTE: If you want to use this for some other excel file, keep in mind that this one has an extra row at the top. You'll have to change the code accordingly for your file! :)
